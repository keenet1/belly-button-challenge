## Background
For this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The primary interactive feature of the dashboard is the drop-down menu used for selecting the Test Subject ID numbers. Note how the other elements of the page (the horizontal bar chart, the bubble chart, the gauge chart, and the demographic information table) all respond as different ID numbers are selected from the Test Subject ID drop down menu. Also note the additional information that displays when hovering the mouse over the individual bars of the bar chart as well as the individual bubbles of the bubble chart.
